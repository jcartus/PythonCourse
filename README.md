# PythonCourse
A short introductory course to python and some basic tools.


## How to use
This course consists of a few [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for python. So you need a running python installation with jupyter and a few more packages installed. To cut this short I would just recommend using [anaconda python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) as their basic package has all the python packages that we will need.

### Step by step:
1) git clone or download and unpack this repo.
2) Download and install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) from continuum.io. Choose the right installer for your system.
3) Start a jupyter server in the folder of your local copy of this repo. In Linux do so using the terminal. On windows use cmd.exe. Details see [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#starting-the-notebook-server).
4) Open the notebooks, read through the information and have some fun. You should try out your new knowledge in the notebook cells. The exercises are optional but recommended. 
5) Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, ideas or suggestions.
